Preface

ABOUT INSIDE MACINTOSH

Inside Macintosh is a three-volume set of manuals that tells you what you need to know to write
software for the Apple® Macintosh™ 128K, 512K, or XL (or a Lisa® running MacWorks™
XL). Although directed mainly toward programmers writing standard Macintosh applications,
Inside Macintosh also contains the information needed to write simple utility programs, desk
accessories, device drivers, or any other Macintosh software. It includes:

- the user interface guidelines for applications on the Macintosh
- a complete description of th e routines available for your program to call (both those built
    into the Macintosh and others on disk), along with related concepts and background
    information
•a description of the Macintosh 128K and 512K hardware
It does not include information about:
- Programming in general.
- Getting started as a developer. For this, write to:

```
Developer Relations
Mail Stop 27-S
Apple Computer, Inc.
20525 Mariani A venue
Cupertino, CA 95014
•Any specific development system, except where indicated. You'll need to have additional
documentation for the development system you're using.
•The Standard Apple Numeric Environment (SANE), which your program can access to
perform extended-precision floating-point arithmetic and transcendental functions. This
environment is described in the Apple Numerics Manual.
You should already be familiar with the basic information that's in Macintosh, the owner's guide,
and have some experience using a standard Macintosh application (such as Mac Write™).
```
The Language

The routines you'll need to call are written in assembly language, but (with a few exceptions)
they're also accessible from high-level languages, such as Pascal on the Lisa Workshop
development system. Inside Macintosh documents the Lisa Pascal interfaces to the routines and
the symbolic names defined for assembly-language programmers using the Lisa Workshop; if
you're using a different development system, its documentation should tell you how to apply the
information presented here to that system.
Inside Macintosh is intended to serve the needs of both high-level language and assembly-
language programmers. Every routine is shown in its Pascal form (if it has one), but assembly-
language programmers are told how they can access the routines. Information of interest only to
assembly-language programmers is isolated and labeled so that other programmers can
conveniently skip it.

```
About Inside Macintosh III- 3
```

Inside Macintosh

Familiarity with Lisa Pascal (or a similar high-level language) is recommended for all readers,
since it's used for most examples. Lisa Pascal is described in the documentation for the Lisa
Pascal Workshop.

What's in Each Volume

Inside Macintosh consists of three volumes. Volume I begins with the following information of
general interest:

- a "road map" to the software and the rest of the documentation
- the user interface guidelines
•an introduction to memory management (the least you need to know, with a complete
discussion following in Volume II)
•some general information for assembly-language programmers
It then describes the various parts of the User Interface Toolbox, the software in ROM that
helps you implement the standard Macintosh user interface in your application. This is followed
by descriptions of other, RAM-based software that's similar in function to the User Interface
Toolbox. (The software overview in the Road Map chapter gives further details.)
Volume II describes the Operating System, the software in ROM that does basic tasks such as
input and output, memory management, and interrupt handling. As in Volume I, some
functionally similar RAM-based software is then described.
Volume III discusses your program's interface with the Finder and then describes the Macintosh
128K and 512K hardware. A comprehensive summary of all the software is provided, followed
by some useful appendices and a glossary of all terms defined in Inside Macintosh.

Version Numbers

```
This edition of Inside Macintosh describes the following versions of the software:
•version 105 of the ROM in the Macintosh 128K or 512K
•version 112 of the ROM image installed by Mac Works in the Macintosh XL
```
- version 1.1 of the Lisa Pascal interfaces and the assembly-language definitions
Some of the RAM-based software is read from the file named System (usually kept in the System
Folder). This manual describes the software in the System file whose creation date is May 2,
1984.

A HORSE OF A DIFFERENT COLOR

```
On an innovative system like the Macintosh, programs don't look quite the way they do on other
systems. For example, instead of carrying out a sequence of steps in a predetermined order, your
program is driven primarily by user actions (such as clicking and typing) whose order cannot be
predicted.
```
Il/4 About Inside Macintosh


Preface

You'll probably find that many of your preconceptions about how to write applications don't
apply here. Because of this, and because of the sheer volume of information in Inside
Macintosh, it's essential that you read the Road Map chapter. It will help you get oriented and
figure out where to go next.

THE STRUCTURE OF A TYPICAL CHAPTER

```
Most chapters of Inside Macintosh have the same structure, as described below. Reading through
this now will save you a lot of time and effort later on. It contains important hints on how to find
what you're looking for within this vast amount of technical documentation.
Every chapter begins with a very brief description of its subject and a list of what you should
already know before reading that chapter. Then there's a section called, for example, "About the
Window Manager", which gives you more information about the subject, telling you what you
can do with it in general, elaborating on related user interface guidelines, and introducing
terminology that will be used in the chapter. This is followed by a series of sections describing
important related concepts and background information; unless they're noted to be for advanced
programmers only, you'll have to read them in order to understand how to use the routines
described later.
Before the routine descriptions themselves, there's a section called, for example, "Using the
Window Manager". It introduces you to the routines, telling you how they fit into the general
flow of an application program and, most important, giving you an idea of which ones you'll
need to use. Often you'll need only a few routines out of many to do basic operations; by reading
this section, you can save yourself the trouble of learning routines you'll never use.
Then, for the details about the routines, read on to the next section. It gives the calling sequence
for each routine and describes all the parameters, effects, side effects, and so on.
Following the routine descriptions, there may be some sections that won't be of interest to all
readers. Usually these contain information about advanced techniques, or behind the scenes
details for the curious.
For review and quick reference, each chapter ends with a summary of the subject matter,
including the entire Pascal interface and a separate section for assembly-language programmers.
```

The Finder I nteiface
```
ABOUT THIS CHAPTER

This chapter describes the interface between a Macintosh application program and the Finder.

```
You should already be familiar with the details of the User Interface Toolbox and the Operating
System.
```
SIGNATURES AND FILE TYPES

Every application must have a unique signature by which the Finder can identify it The
signature can be any four-character sequence not being used for another application on any
currently mounted volume (except that it can't be one of the standard resource types). To ensure
uniqueness on all volumes, you must register your application's signature by writing to:

```
Macintosh Technical Support
Mail Stop 3-T
Apple Computer, Inc.
20525 Mariani A venue
Cupertino, CA 95014
```
```
Note: There's no need to register your own resource types, since they'll usually exist
only in your own applications or documents.
```
```
Signatures work together with tile types to enable the user to open or print a document (any file
created by an application) from the Finder. When the application creates a file, it sets the file's
creator and file type. Normally it sets the creator to its signature and the file type to a four-
character sequence that identifies files of that type. When the user asks the Finder to open or print
the file, the Finder starts up the application whose signature is the file's creator and passes the file
type to the application along with other identifying information, such as the file name. (More
information about this process is given in chapter 2 of Volume II.)
An application may create its own special type or types of files. Like signatures, file types must
be registered with Macintosh Technical Support to ensure uniqueness. When the user chooses
Open from an application's File menu, the application will display (via the Standard File Package)
the names of all files of a given type or types, regardless of which application created the files.
Having a unique file type for your application's special files ensures that only the names of those
files will be displayed for opening.
```
```
Note: Signatures and file types may be strange, unreadable combinations of characters;
they're never seen by end users of Macintosh.
```
```
Applications may also create existing types of files. There might, for example, be an application
that merges two Mac Write documents into a single document. In such cases, the application
should use the same file type as the original application uses for those files. It should also specify
the original application's signature as the file's creator; that way, when the user asks the Finder to
open or print the file, the Finder will call on the original application to perform the operation. To
learn the signature and file types used by an existing application, check with the application's
manufacturer.
```
```
Signatures and File Types Ill-
```

Inside Macintosh

```
Files that consist only of text-a stream of characters, with Return characters at the ends of
paragraphs or short lines-should be given the standard file type TEXT'. This is the type that
Mac Write gives to text only files it creates, for example. If your application uses this file type, its
files will be accepted by MacWrite and it in turn will accept Mac Write text-only files (likewise for
any other application that deals with TEXT' files, such as MacTerminal). Your application can
give its own signature as the file's creator if it wants to be called to open or print the file when the
user requests this from the Finder.
For files that aren't to be opened or printed from the Finder, as may be the case for certain data
files created by the application, the creator should be set to '????' (and the file type to whateve r is
appropriate).
```
FINDER-RELATED RESOURCES

To establish the proper interface with the Finder, every application's resource file must specify
the signature of the application along with data that provides version information. In addition,
there may be resources that provide information about icons and files related to the application.
All of these Finder-related resources are described below, followed by a comprehensive example
and (for interested programmers) the exact formats of the resources.

Version Data

```
Your application's resource file must contain a special resource that has the signature of the
application as its resource type. This resource is called the version data of the application. The
version data is typically a string that gives the name, version number, and date of the application,
but it can in fact be any data at all. The resource ID of the version data is 0 by convention.
Part of the process of installing an application on the Macintosh is to set the creator of the file that
contains the application. You set the creator to the application's signature, and the Finder copies
the corresponding version data into a resource file named Desktop. (The Finder doesn't display
this file on the Macintosh desktop, to ensure that the user won't tamper with it.)
```
```
Note: Additional, related resources may be copied into the Desktop file; see "Bundles"
below for more information.
```
Icons and File References

```
For each application, the Finder needs to know:
```
- the icon to be displayed for the application on the desktop, if different from the Finde r's
    default icon for applications (see Figure 1)
- if the application creates any files, the icon to be displayed for each type of file it creates, if
different from the Finder's default icon for documents

```
The Finder learns this information from resources called file references in the application's
resource file. Each file reference contains a file type and an ID number, called a local ID, that
identifies the icon to be displayed for that type of file. (The local ID is mapped to an actual
resource ID as described under "Bundles" below.)
```

```
The file type for the application itself is 'APPL'. This is the file type in the file reference that
designates the application's icon. You also specify it as the application's file type at the same time
that you specify its creator-when you install the application on the Macintosh.
```
```
The ID number in a file ref~rence corresponds not to a single icon but to an icon list in the
application's resource file. The icon list consists of two icons: the actual icon to be displayed on
the desktop, and a mask consisting of that icon's outline filled with black (see Figure 2).
```
# Icon • Mask

```
Figure 2. Icon and Mask
```
Bundles

A bundle in the application's resource file groups together all the Finder-related resources. It
specifies the following:

- the application's signature and the resource ID of its version data
- a mapping between the local IDs for icon lists (as specified in file references) and the actual
    resource IDs of the icon lists in the resource file
- local IDs for the file references themselves and a mapping to their actual resource IDs

When you install the application on the Macintosh, you set its "bundle bit"; the first time the
Finder sees this, it copies the version data, bundle, icon lists, and file references from the
application's resource file into the Desktop file. If there are any resource ID conflicts between the
icon lists and file references in the application's resource file and those in Desktop, the Finder will
change those resource IDs in Desktop. The Finder does this same resource copying and ID
conflict resolution when you transfer an application to another volume.

```
Note: The local IDs are needed only for use by the Finder.
```
An Example

```
Suppose you've written an application named SampWriter. The user can create a unique type of
document from it, and you want a distinctive icon for both the application and its documents. The
application's signature, as recorded with Macintosh Technical Support, is 'SAMP'; the file type
assigned for its documents is 'SAMF'. You would include the following resources in the
application's resource file:

```
```
Note: See the documentation for the development system you're using for information
about how to include these resources in a resource file.
```
Formats of Finder-Related Resources

The resource type for an application's version data is the signature of the application, and the
resource ID is 0 by convention. The resource data can be anything at all; typically it's a string
giving the name, version number, and date of the application.

The resource type for an icon list is 'ICN#'. The resource data simply consists of the icons, 128
bytes each.

The resource type for a file reference is 'FREF. The resource data has the format shown below.

```

ABOUT THIS CHAPTER

This chapter provides a basic description of the hardware of the Macintosh 128K and 512K
computers. It gives you information that you'll need to connect other devices to the Macintosh
and to write device drivers or other low-level programs. It will help you figure out which
technical documents you'll need to design peripherals; in some cases, you'll have to obtain
detailed specifications from the manufacturers of the various interface chips. -

This chapter is oriented toward assembly-language programmers. It assumes you're familiar with
the basic operation of microprocessor-based devices. Knowledge of the Macintosh Operating
System will also be helpful.

```
Warning: Only the Macintosh 128K and 512K are covered in this chapter. In particular,
note that the memory addresses and screen size are different on the Macintosh XL (and
may be different in future versions of the Macintosh). To maintain software compatibility
across the Macintosh line, and to allow for future changes to the hardware, you're strongly
advised to use the Toolbox and Operating System routines wherever possible.
```
To learn how your program can determine which hardware environment it's operating in, see the
description of the Environs procedure in chapter 13 of Volume II.

OVERVIEW OF THE HARDWARE

The Macintosh computer contains a Motorola MC68000 microprocessor clocked at 7.8336
megahertz, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), and several chips that
enable it to communicate with external devices. There are five I/O devices: the video display; the
sound generator; a Synertek SY6522 Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA) for the mouse and
keyboard; a Zilog Z8530 Serial Communications Controller (SCC) for serial communication; and
an Apple custom chip, called the IWM ("Integrated Woz Machine") for disk control.

The Macintosh uses memory-mapped 1/0, which means that each device in the system is accessed
by reading or writing to specific locations in the address space of the computer. Each device
contains logic that recognizes when it's being accessed and responds in the appropriate manner.

The MC68000 can directly access 16 megabytes (Mb) of address space. In the Macintosh, this is
divided into four equal sections. The first four Mb are for RAM, the second four Mb are for
ROM, the third are for the SCC, and the last four are for the IWM and the VIA. Since each of the
devices within the blocks has far fewer than four Mb of individually addressable locations or
registers, the addresses within each block "wrap around" and are. repeated several times within the
block.
RAM is the "working memory" of the system. Its base address is address 0. The first 256 bytes
of RAM (addresses 0 through $FF) are used by the MC68000 as exception vectors; these are
the addresses of the routines that gain control when~ver an exception such as an interrupt or a trap
occurs. (The summary at the end of this chapter includes a list of all the exception vectors.)
RAM also contains the system and application heaps, the stack, and other information used by
applications. In addition, the following hardware devices share the use of RAM with the
MC68000:

```
Overview of the Hardware III-17
```

Inside Macintosh

```
•the video display, which reads the infonnation for the display from one of two screen
buffers
```
- the sound generator, which reads its infonnation from one of two sound buffers
- the disk speed controller, which shares its data space with the sound buffers

```
The MC68000 accesses to RAM are interleaved (alternated) with the video display's accesses
during the active portion of a screen scan line (video scanning is described in the next section).
The sound generator and disk speed controller are given the first access after each scan line. At
all other times, the MC68000 has unintenupted access to RAM, increasing the average RAM
access rate to about 6 megahertz (MHz).
ROM is the system's pennanent read-only memory. Its base address, $400000, is available as
the constant romStart and is also stored in the global variable ROMBase. ROM contains the
routines for the Toolbox and Operating System, and the various system traps. Since the ROM is
used exclusively by the MC68000, it's always accessed at the full processor rate of 7.83 MHz.
The address space reserved for the device 1/0 contains blocks devoted to each of the devices
within the computer. This region begins at address $800000 and continues to the highest address
at $FFFFFF.
```
```
Note: Since the VIA is involved in some way in almost every operation of the Macintosh,
the following sections frequently refer to the VIA and VIA-related constants. The VIA
itself is described later, and all the constants are listed in the summary at the end of this
chapter.
```
THE VIDEO INTERFACE

```
The video display is created by a moving electron beam that scans across the screen, turning on
and off as it scans in order to create black and white pixels. Each pixel is a square, approximately
1174 inch on a side.
```
```
To create a screen image, the electron beam starts at the top left comer of the screen (see
Figure 1). The beam scans horizontally across the screen from left to right, creating the top line
of graphics. When it reaches the last pixel on the right end of the top line it turns off, and
continues past the last pixel to the physical right edge of the screen. Then it flicks invisibly back
to the left edge and moves down one scan line. After tracing across the black border, it begins
displaying the data in the second scan line. The time between the display of the rightmost pixel
on one line and the leftmost pixel on the next is called the horizontal blanking interval. When
the electron beam reaches the last pixel of the last (342nd) line on the screen, it traces out to the
right edge and then flicks up to the top left corner, where it traces the left border and then begins
once again to display the top line. The time between the last pixel on the bottom line and the first
one on the top line is called the vertical blanking interval. At the beginning of the vertical
blanking interval, the VIA generates a vertical blanking interrupt.
The pixel clock rate (the frequency at which pixels are displayed) is 15 .6672 MHz, or about .064
microseconds (μsec) per pixel. For each scan line, 512 pixels are drawn on the screen, requiring
32.68 μsec. The horizontal blanking interval takes the time of an additional 192 pixels, or 12.25
μsec. Thus, each full scan line takes 44.93 μsec, which means the horizontal scan rate is 22.25
kilohertz.

Figure 1. Video Scanning Pattern
```
A full screen display consists of 342 horizontal scan lines, occupying 15367 .65 μsec, or about
15.37 milliseconds (msec). The vertical blanking interval takes the time of an additional 28 scan
lines-1258. 17 μsec, or about 1.26 msec. This means the full screen is redisplayed once every
16625.8 μsec. That's about 16 .6 msec per frame, which means the vertical scan rate (the full
screen display frequency) is 60.15 hertz.

The video generator uses 21,888 bytes of RAM to compose a bit-mapped video image 512 pixels
wide by 342 pixels tall. Each bit in this range controls a single pixel in the image: A 0 bit is
white, and a 1 bit is black.

There are two screen buffers (areas of memory from which the video circuitry can read
information to create a screen display): the main buffer and the alternate buffer. The starting
addresses of the screen buffers depend on how much memory you have in your Macintosh. In a
Macintosh 128K, the main screen buffer starts at $1A700 and the alternate buffer starts at
$12700; for a 512K Macintosh, add $60000 to these numbers.

```
Warning: To be sure you don't use the wrong area of memory and to maintain
compatibility with future Macintosh systems, you should get the video base address and bit
map dimensions from screenBits (see chapter 6 of Volume I).
```
Each scan line of the screen displays the contents of 32 consecutive words of memory, each word
controlling 16 horizontally adjacent pixels. In each word, the high-order bit (bit 15) controls the
leftmost pixel and the low-order bit (bit 0) controls the rightmost pixel. The first word in each
scan line follows the last word on the line above it. The starting address of the screen is thus in

```
The Video Interface III-19

```
the top left comer, and the addresses progress from there to the right and down, to the last byte in
the extreme bottom right corner.
Normally, the video display doesn't flicker when you read from or write to it, because the video
memory accesses are interleaved with the processor accesses. But if you're creating an animated
image by repeatedly drawing the graphics in quick succession, it may appear to flicker if the
electron beam displays it when your program hasn't finished updating it, showing some of the
new image and some of the old in the same frame.
One way to prevent flickering when you're updating the screen continuously is to use the vertical
and horizontal blanking signals to synchronize your updates to the scanning of video memory.
Small changes to your screen can be completed entirely during the interval between frames (the
first 1.26 msec following a vertical blanking interrupt), when nothing is being displayed on the
screen. When making larger changes, the trick is to keep your changes happening always ahead
of the spot being displayed by the electron beam, as it scans byte by byte through the video
memory. Changes you make in the memory already passed over by the scan spot won't appear
until the next frame. If you start changing your image when the vertical blanking interrupt occurs,
you have 1.26 msec of unrestricted access to the image. After that, you can change progressively
less and less of your image as it's scanned onto the screen, starting from the top (the lowest video
memory address). From vertical blanking interrupt, you have only 1.26 msec in which to change
the first (lowest address) screen location, but you have almost 16.6 msec to change the last
(highest address) screen location.
Another way to create smooth, flicker-free graphics, especially useful with changes that may take
more 16.6 msec, is to use the two screen buffers as alternate displays. If you draw into the one
that's currently not being displayed, and then switch the buffers during the next vertical blanking,
your graphics will change all at' once, producing a clean animation. (See chapter 11 of Volume II
to find out how to specify tasks to be performed during vertical blanking.)
If you want to use the alternate screen buffer, you'll have to specify this to the Segment Loader
(see chapter 2 of Volume II for details). To switch to the alternate screen buffer, clear the
following bit of VIA data register A (vBase+vBufA):
```
```
vPage2 .EQU 6 ;O = alternate screen buffer
```
```
For example:
```
```
BCLR #vPage2,vBase+vBufA
```
```
To switch back to the main buffer, set the same bit.
```
```
Warning: Whenever you change a bit in a VIA data register, be sure to leave the other
bits in the register unchanged.
```
```
Warning: The alternate screen buffer may not be supported in future versions of the
Macintosh.
```
THE SOUND GENERATOR

```
The Macintosh sound circuitry uses a series of values taken from an area of RAM to create a
changing waveform in the output signal. This signal drives a small speaker inside the Macintosh
```
```
III-20 The Video Interface
```

```
The Macintosh Hardware
```
```
and is connected to the external sound jack on the back of the computer. If a plug is inserted into
the external sound jack, the internal speaker is disabled. The external sound line can drive a load
of 600 or more ohms, such as the input of almost any audio amplifier, but not a directly
connected external speaker.
```
The sound generator may be turned on or off by writing 1 (off) or 0 (on) to the following bit of
VIA data register B (vBase+vBufB):

vSndEnb .EQU 7 ;O sound enabled, 1 = disabled

```
For example:
```
```
BSET #vSndEnb,vBase+vBufB ;turn off sound
```
By storing a range of values in the sound buffer, you can create the corresponding waveform in
the sound channel. The sound generator uses a form of pulse-width encoding to create sounds.
The sound circuitry reads one word in the sound buffer during each horizontal blanking interval
(including the "virtual" intervals during vertical blanking) and uses the high-order byte of the
word to generate a pulse of electricity whose duration (width) is proportional to the value in the
byte. Another circuit converts this pulse into a voltage that's attenuated (reduced) by a three-bit
value from the VIA. This reduction corresponds to the current setting of the volume level. To set
the volume directly, store a three-bit number in the low-order bits of VIA data register A
(vBase+vBufA). You can use the following constant to isolate the bits involved:

vSound .EQU (^7) ;sound volume bits
Here's an example of how to set the sound level:
MOVE. B
ANDI.B
ORI.B
MOVE.B
vBase+vBufA,DO
#255-vSound,DO
#3,DO
DO,vBase+vBufA
;get current value of register A
;clear the sound bits
;set medium sound level
;put the data back
After attenuation, the sound signal is passed to the audio output line.
The sound circuitry scans the sound buffer at a fixed rate of 370 words per video frame, repeating
the full cycle 60.15 times per second. To create sounds with frequencies other than multiples of
the basic scan rate, you must store phase-shifted patterns into the sound buffer between each
scan. You can use the vertical and horizontal blanking signals (available in the VIA) to
synchronize your sound buffer updates to the buffer scan. You may find that it's much easier to
use the routines in the Sound Driver to do these functions.
Warning: The low-order byte of each word in the sound buffer is used to control the
speed of the motor in the disk drive. Don't store any information there, or you'll interfere
with the disk 110.
There are two sound buffers, just as there are two screen buffers. The address of the main sound
buffer is stored in the global variable SoundBase and is also available as the constant soundLow.
The main sound buffer is at $1FDOO in a 128K Macintosh, and the alternate buffer is at $1Al00;
for a 512K Macintosh, add $60000 to these values. Each sound buffer contains 370 words of
data. As when you want to use the alternate screen buffer, you'll have to specify to the Segment
Loader that you want the alternate buffer (see chapter 2 of Volume II for details). To select the
alternate sound buffer for output, clear the following bit of VIA data register A (vBase+vBufA):
The Sound Generator Ill-21


Inside Macintosh

vSndPg2 .EQU 3 ;0 = alternate sound buffer

To return to the main buffer, set the same bit.

```
Warning: Be sure to switch back to the main sound buffer before doing a disk access, or
the disk won't work properly.
```
```
Warning: The alternate sound buffer may not be supported in future versions of the
Macintosh.
```
There's another way to generate a simple, square-wave tone of any frequency, using almost no
processor intervention. To do this, first load a constant value into all 370 sound buffer locations
(use $00's for minumum volume, $FFs for maximum volume). Next, load a value into the
VIA's timer 1 latches, and set the high-order two bits of the VIA's auxiliary control register
(vBase+vACR) for "square wave output" from timer 1. The timer will then count down from the
latched value at 1.2766 μsecJcount, over and over, inverting the vSndEnb bit of VIA register B
(vBase+vBuffi) after each count down. This takes the constant voltage being generated from the
sound buffer and turns it on and off, creating a square-wave sound whose period is

2 * 1.2766 μsec * timer l's latched value

```
Note: You may want to disable timer 1 interrupts during this process (bit 6 in the VIA's
interrupt enable register, which is at vBase+vIER).
```
To stop the square-wave sound, reset the high-order two bits of the auxiliary control register.

```
Note: See the SY6522 technical specifications for details of the VIA registers. See also
"Sound Driver Hardware" in chapter 8 of Volume II.

THE sec

The two serial ports are controlled by a Zilog Z8530 Serial Communications Controller
(SCC). The port known as SCC port A is the one with the modem icon on the back of the
Macintosh. SCC port B is the one with the printer icon.
Macintosh serial ports conform to the EIA standard RS422, which differs from the more common
RS232C standard. While RS232C modulates a signal with respect to a common ground ("single-
ended" transmission), RS422 modulates two signals against each other ("differential"
transmission). The RS232C receiver senses whether the received signal is sufficiently negative
with respect to ground to be a logic "l", whereas the RS422 receiver simply senses which line is
more negative than the other. This makes RS422 more immune to noise and interference, and
more versatile over longer distances. If you ground the positive side of each RS422 receiver and
leave unconnected the positive side of each transmitter, you've converted to EIA standard RS423,
which can be used to communicate with most RS232C devices over distances up to fifty feet or
so.

Inside Macintosh

The serial inputs and outputs of the SCC are connected to the ports through differential line
drivers (26LS30) and receivers (26LS32). The line drivers can be put in high-impedance mode
between transmissions, to allow other devices to transmit over those lines. A driver is activated
by lowering the SCC's Request To Send (RTS) output for that port. Port A and port B are
identical except that port A (the modem port) has a higher interrupt priority, making it more
suitable for high-speed communication.
Figure 3 shows the DB-9 pinout for the SCC output jacks.

```
Warning: Do not draw more than 100 milliamps at +12 volts, and 200 milliamps at +5
volts from all connectors combined.
```
```
Each port's input-only handshake line (pin 7) is connected to the SCC's Clear To Send (CTS)
input for that port, and is designed to accept an external device's Data Terminal Ready (DTR)
handshake signal. This line is also connected to the SCC's external synchronous clock (TRxC)
input for that port, so that an external device can perform high-speed synchronous data exchange.
Note that you can't use the line for receiving DTR if you're using it to receive a high-speed data
clock.
The handshake line is sensed by the Macintosh using the positive (noninverting) input of one of
the standard RS422 receivers (26LS32 chip), with the negative input grounded. The positive
input was chosen because this configuration is more immune to noise when no active device is
connected to pin 7.
```
```
Note: Because this is a differential receiver, any handshake or clock signal driving it must
be "bi-polar", alternating between a positive voltage and a negative voltage, with respect to
the internally grounded negative input. If a device tries to use ground (0 volts) as one of its
handshake logic levels, the Macintosh will receive that level as an indeterminate state, with
unpredictable results.
```
III-24 The sec


```
The Macintosh Hardware
```
The sec itself (at its PCLK pin) is clocked at 3.672 megahertz. The internal synchronous clock
(RTxC) pins for both ports are also connected to this 3.672 MHz clock. This is the clock that,
after dividing by 16, is normally fed to the SeC's internal baud-rate generator.

The sec chip generates level- 1 processor interrupts during 110 over the serial lines. For more
information about SeC interrupts, see chapter 6 of Volume II.

The locations of the SCC control and data lines are given in the following table as offsets from
the constant sccWBase for writes, or sccRBase for reads. These base addresses are also available
in the global variables SCCWr and SCCRd. The SCC is on the upper byte of the data bus, so
y0u must use only even-addressed byte reads (a byte read of an odd SCC read address tries to
reset the entire SCC). When writing, however, you must use only odd-addressed byte writes (the
MC68000 puts your data on both bytes of the bus, so it works correctly). A word access to any
sec address will shift the phase of the computer's high-frequency timing by 128 nanoseconds
(system software adjusts it correctly during the system startup process).

THE MOUSE

The DB-9 connector labeled with the mouse icon connects to the Apple mouse (Apple II,
Apple III, Lisa, and Macintosh mice are electrically identical). The mouse generates four square-
wave signals that describe the amount and direction of the mouse's travel. Interrupt-driven
routines in the Macintosh ROM convert this information into the corresponding motion of the
pointer on the screen. By turning an option called mouse scaling on or off in the Control Panel
desk accessory, the user can change the amount of screen pointer motion that corresponds to a

given mouse motion, depending on how fast the mouse is moved; for more information about
mouse scaling, see the discussion of parameter RAM in chapter 13 of Volume II.

```
Note: The mouse is a relative-motion device; that is, it doesn't report where it is, only
how far and in which direction it's moving. So if you want to connect graphics tablets,
touch screens, light pens, or other absolute-position devices to the mouse port, you must
either convert their coordinates into motion information or install your own device-handling
routines.
```
The mouse operates by sending square-wave trains of information to the Macintosh that change
as the velocity and direction of motion change. The rubber-coated steel ball in the mouse contacts
two capstans, each connected to an interrupter wheel: Motion along the mouse's X axis rotates
one of the wheels and motion along the Y axis rotates the other wheel.

The Macintosh uses a scheme known as quadrature to detect which direction the mouse is moving
along each axis. There's a row of slots on an interrupter wheel, and two beams of infrared light
shine through the slots, each one aimed at a phototransistor detector. The detectors are offset just
enough so that, as the wheel turns, they produce two square-wave signals (called the interrupt
signal and the quadrature signal) 90 degrees out of phase. The quadrature signal precedes the
interrupt signal by 90 degrees when the wheel turns one way, and trails it when the wheel turns
the other way.
The interrupt signals, Xl and Yl, are connected to the SCC's DCDA and DCDB inputs,
respectively, while the quadrature signals, X2 and Y2, go to inputs of the VIA's data register B.
When the Macintosh is interrupted (from the SCC) by the rising edge of a mouse interrupt signal,
it checks the VIA for the state of the quadrature signal for that axis: If it's low, the mouse is
moving to the left (or down), and if it's high, the mouse is moving to the right (or up). When the
sec interrupts on the falling edge, a high quadrature level indicates motion to the left (or down)
and a low quadrature level indicates motion to the right (or up):

```
sec VIA Mouse
Mouse interrupt Mouse quadrature Motion direction in
XI (or Yl) X2 (or Y2) X (or Y) axis
Positive edge Low Left (or down)
High Right (or up)
Negative edge Low Right (or up)
High Left (or down)
```
```
Figure 5 shows the interrupt (YI) and quadrature (Y2) signals when the mouse is moved
downwards.
The switch on the mouse is a pushbutton that grounds pin 7 on the mouse connector when
pressed. The state of the button is checked by software during each vertical blanking interrupt.
The small delay between each check is sufficient to debounce the button. You can look directly at
the mouse button's state by examining the following bit of VIA data register B (vBase+vBufB):
```
```
vSW .EQU 3 ;O =mouse button is down
```
```
If the bit is clear, the mouse button is down. However, it's recommended that you let the
Operating System handle this for you through the event mechanism.

THE KEYBOARD AND KEYPAD

The Macintosh keyboard and numeric keypad each contain an Intel 8021 microprocessor that
scans the keys. The 8021 contains ROM and RAM, and is programmed to conform to the
interface protocol described below.

The keyboard plugs into the Macintosh through a four-wire RJ-11 telephone-style jack. If a
numeric keypad is installed in the system, the keyboard plugs into it and it in turn plugs into the

Keyboard Communication Protocol

```
The keyboard data line is bidirectional and is driven by whatever device is sending data. The
keyboard clock line is driven by the keyboard only. All data transfers are synchronous with the
keyboard clock. Each transmission consists of eight bits, with the highest-order bits first.
When sending data to the Macintosh, the keyboard clock transmits eight 330-μsec cycles (160
μsec low, 170 μsec high) on the normally high clock line. It places the data bit on the data line 40
μsec before the falling edge of the clock line and maintains it for 330 μsec. The data bit is
clocked into the Macintosh's VIA shift register on the rising edge of the keyboard clock cycle.
When the Macintosh sends data to the keyboard, the keyboard clock transmits eight 400-μsec
cycles (180 μsec low, 220 μsec high) on the clock line. On the falling edge of the keyboard clock
cycle, the Macintosh places the data bit on the data line and holds it there for 400 μsec. The
keyboard reads the data bit 80 μsec after the rising edge of the keyboard clock cycle.
Only the Macintosh can initiate communication over the keyboard lines. On power-up of either
the Macintosh or the keyboard, the Macintosh is in charge, and the external device is passive.
The Macintosh signals that it's ready to begin communication by pulling the keyboard data line
low. Upon detecting this, the keyboard starts clocking and the Macintosh sends a command.
The last bit of the command leaves the keyboard data line low; the Macintosh then indicates it's
ready to receive the keyboard's response by setting the data line high.
The first command the Macintosh sends out is the Model Number command. The keyboard's
response to this command is to reset itself and send back its model number to the Macintosh. If
no response is received for 112 second, the Macintosh tries the Model Number command again.
Once the Macintosh has successfully received a model number from the keyboard, normal
```
ll/-30 The Keyboard and Keypad


```
The Macintosh Hardware
```
operation can begin. The Macintosh sends the Inquiry command; the keyboard sends back a Key
Transition response if a key has been pressed or released. If no key transition has occurred after
1/4 second, the keyboard sends back a Null response to let the Macintosh know it's still there.
The Macintosh then sends the Inquiry command again. In normal operation, the Macintosh sends
out an Inquiry command every 1/4 second. If it receives no response within 1/2 second, it
assumes the keyboard is missing or needs resetting, so it begins again with the Model Number
command.

There are two other commands the Macintosh can send: the Instant command, which gets an
instant keyboard status without the 1/4-second timeout, and the Test command, to perform a
keyboard self-test. Here's a list of the commands that can be sent from the Macintosh to the
keyboard:

Bits 4-6: next device number, 1-8
Bit 7: 1 if another device connected
ACK ($7D) or NAK ($77)
```
The Key Transition responses are sent out by the keyboard as a single byte: Bit 7 high means a
key-up transition, and bit 7 low means a key-down. Bit 0 is always high. The Key Transition
responses for key-down transitions on the keyboard are shown (in hexadecimal) in Figure 9.
Note that these response codes are different from the key codes returned by the keyboard driver
software. The keyboard driver strips off bit 7 of the response and shifts the result one bit to the
right, removing bit 0. For example, response code $33 becomes $19, and $2B becomes $15.

Keypad Communication Protocol

When a numeric keypad is used, it must be inserted between the keyboard and the Macintosh; that
is, the keypad cable plugs into the jack on the front of the Macintosh, and the keyboard cable
plugs into a jack on the numeric keypad. In this configuration, the timings and protocol for the
clock and data lines work a little differently: The keypad acts like a keyboard when
communicating with the Macintosh, and acts like a Macintosh when communicating over the
separate clock and data lines going to the keyboard. All commands from the Macintosh are now
received by the keypad instead of the keyboard, and only the keypad can communicate directly
with the keyboard.

When the Macintosh sends out an Inquiry command, one of two things may happen, depending
on the state of the keypad. If no key transitions have occurred on the keypad since the last
Inquiry, the keypad sends an Inquiry command to the keyboard and, later, retransmits the
keyboard's response back to the Macintosh. But if a key transition has occurred on the keypad,
the keypad responds to an Inquiry by sending back the Keypad response ($79) to the Macintosh.
In that case, the Macintosh immediately sends an Instant command, and this time the keypad
sends back its own Key Transition response. As with the keyboard, bit 7 high means key-up and
bit 7 low means key-down.

THE DISK INTERFACE

The Macintosh disk interface uses a design similar to that used on the Apple II and Apple III
computers, employing the Apple custom IWM chip. Another custom chip called the Analog
Signal Generator (ASG) reads the disk speed buffer in RAM and generates voltages that control
the disk speed. Together with the VIA, the IWM and the ASG generate all the signals necessary
to read, write, format, and eject the 3 1/2-inch disks used by the Macintosh.

The IWM controls four of the disk state-control lines (called CAO, CAI, CA2, and LSTRB),
chooses which drive (internal or external) to enable, and processes the disk's read-data and write-
data signals. The VIA provides another disk state-control line called SEL.

A buffer in RAM (actually the low-order bytes of words in the sound buffer) is read by the ASG
to generate a pulse-width modulated signal that's used to control the speed of the disk motor.
The Macintosh Operating System uses this speed control to allow it to store more sectors of
information in the tracks closer to the edge of the disk by running the disk motor at slower
speeds.
Figure 10 shows the DB-19 pinout for the external disk jack at the back of the Macintosh.

Controlling the Disk State-Control Lines

The IWM contains registers that can be used by the software to control the state-control lines
leading out to the disk. By reading or writing certain memory locations, you can tum these state-
control lines on or off. Other locations set various IWM internal states. The locations are given
in the following table as offsets from the constant dBase, the base address of the IWM; this base
address is also available in a global variable named IWM. The IWM i~ on the lower byte of the
data bus, so use odd-addressed byte accesses only. ·

```
Location to Location to
IWM line turn line on turn line off
Disk state-control lines:
CAO dBase+phOH dBase+phOL
CAI dBase+phlH dBase+phlL
CA2 dBase+ph2H dBase+ph2L
LSTRB dBase+ph3H dBase+ph3L
```
```
Disk enable line:

```
```
IWM internal states:
SELECT dBase+extDrive dBase+intDrive
Q6 dBase+q6H dBase+q6L
Q7 dBase+q7H dBase+q7L
```
```
To tum one of the lines on or off, do any kind of memory byte access (read or write) to the
respective location.
The CAO, CAl, and CA2 lines are used along with the SEL line from the VIA to select from
among the registers and data signals in the disk drive. The LSfRB line is used when writing
control information to the disk registers (as described below), and the ENABLE line enables the
selected disk drive. SELECT is an IWM internal line that chooses which disk drive can be
enabled: On selects the external drive, and off selects the internal drive. The Q6 and Q7 lines are
used to set up the internal state of the IWM for reading disk register information, as well as for
reading or writing actual disk-storage data.
You can read information from several registers in the disk drive to find out whether the disk is
locked, whether a disk is in the drive, whether the head is at track 0, how many heads the drive
has, and whether there's a drive connected at all. In tum, you can write to some of these
registers to step the head, turn the motor on or off, and eject the disk.
```
Reading from the Disk Registers

```
Before you can read from any of the disk registers, you must set up the state of the IWM so that it
can pass the data through to the MC68000's memory space where you'll be able to read it. To do
that, you must first tum off Q7 by reading or writing dBase+q7L. Then tum on Q6 by accessing
dBase+q6H. After that, the IWM will be able to pass data from the disk's RD/SENSE line
through to you.
```
```
///-34 The Disk Interface
```

```
The Macintosh Hardware
```
```
Once you've set up the IWM for disk register access, you must next select which register you
want to read. To read one of the disk registers, first enable the drive you want to use (by
accessing dBase+intDrive or dBase+extDrive and then dBase+rnotorOn) and make sure LSTRB
is low. Then set CAO, CAI, CA2, and SEL to address the register you want. Once this is done,
you can read the disk register data bit in the high-order bit of dBase+q7L. After you've read the
data, you may read another disk register by again setting the proper values in CAO, CAl, CA2,
and SEL, and then reading dBase+q7L.
```
```
Warning: When you're finished reading data from the disk registers, it's important to
leave the IWM in a state that the Disk Driver will recognize. To be sure it's in a valid logic
state, always tum Q6 back off (by accessing dBase+q6L) after you've finished reading the
disk registers.
```
The following table shows how you must set the disk state-control lines to read from the various
disk registers and data signals:

```
State-control lines Register
CA2 CAl CAO SEL addressed Information in register
0 0 0 0 DffiTN Head step direction
0 0 0 1 CSTIN Disk in place

1 0 0 1 RDDATAl Read data, upper head
1 1 0 0 SIDES Single-or double-sided drive
1 1 1 1 DRVIN Drive installed
```
Writing to the Disk Registers

```
To write to a disk register, first be sure that LSTRB is off, then tum on CAO and CAL Next, set
SEL to 0. Set CAO and CAl to the proper values from the table below, then set CA2 to the value
you want to write to the disk register. Hold LSTRB high for at least one μsec but not more than
one msec (unless you're ejecting a disk) and bring it low again. Be sure that you don't change
CAO-CA2 or SEL while LSTRB is high, and that CAO and CAl are set high before changing
SEL.
The following table shows how you must set the disk state-control lines to write to the various

Explanations of the Disk Registers

The information written to or read from the various disk registers can be interpreted as follows:

- The DIRTN signal sets the direction of subsequent head stepping: 0 causes steps to go
    toward the inside track (track 79), 1 causes them to go toward the outside track (track 0).
- CSTIN is 0 only when a disk is in the drive.
- Setting STEP to 0 steps the head one full track in the direction last set by DIRTN. When
    the step is complete (about 12 msec), the disk drive sets STEP back to 1, and then you can
       step again.
- WRTPRT is 0 whenever the disk is locked. Do not write to a disk unless WRTPRT is 1.
- MOTOR ON controls the state of the disk motor: 0 turns on the motor, and 1 turns it off.
    The motor will run only if the drive is enabled and a disk is in place; otherwise, writing to
    this line will have no effect.
- TKO goes to 0 only if the head is at track 0. This is valid beginning 12 msec after the step
    that puts it at track 0.
•Writing 1 to EJECT ejects the disk from the drive. To eject a disk, you must hold LSTRB
    high for at least 1/2 second.
- The current disk speed is available as a pulse train on T ACH. The TACH line produces 60
    pulses for each rotation of the drive motor. The disk motor speed is controlled by the ASG
    as it reads the disk speed RAM buffer.
- RDDA TAO and RD DAT A 1 carry the instantaneous data from the disk head.
- SIDES is always 0 on single-sided drives and 1 on double-sided drives.
- DRVIN is always 0 if the selected disk drive is physically connected to the Macintosh,
    otherwise it floats to 1.

THE REAL-TIME CLOCK

```
The Macintosh real-time clock is a custom chip whose interface lines are available through the
VIA. The clock contains a four-byte counter that's incremented once each second, as well as a
line that can be used by the VIA to generate an interrupt once each second. It also contains 20
bytes of RAM that are powered by a battery when the Macintosh is turned off. These RAM
bytes, called parameter RAM, contain important data that needs to be preserved even when the
system power is not available. The Operating System maintains a copy of parameter RAM that
you can access in low memory. To find out how to use the values in parameter RAM, see chapter
13 of Volume Il.
```
```
111-36 The Disk Interface
```

```
The Macintosh Hardware
```
Accessing the Clock Chip

```
The clock is accessed through the following bits of VIA data register B (vBase+vBufB):
```
```
rTCData
rTCClk
rTCEnb
```
```
.EQU
.EQU
.EQU
```
```
0
1
2
```
```
;real-time clock serial data line
;real-ti.me clock data-clock line
;real-time clock serial enable
```
```
These three bits constitute a simple serial interface. The rTCData bit is a bidirectional serial data
line used to send command and data bytes back and forth. The rTCClk bit is a data-clock line,
always driven by the processor (you set it high or low yourself) that regulates the transmission of
the data and command bits. The rTCEnb bit is the serial enable line, which signals the real-time
clock that the processor is about to send it serial commands and data.
```
To access the clock chip, you must first enable its serial function. To do this, set the serial enable
line (rTCEnb) to 0. Keep the serial enable line ~ow during the entire transaction; if you set it to 1,
you'll abort the transfer.

```
Warning: Be sure you don't alter any of bits 3-7 of VIA data register B during clock
serial access.
```
```
A command can be either a write request or a read request. After the eight bits of a write request,
the clock will expect the next eight bits across the serial data line to be your data for storage into
one of the internal registers of the clock. After receiving the eight bits of a read request, the clock
will respond by putting eight bits of its data on the serial data line. Commands and data are
transferred serially in eight-bit groups over the serial data line, with the high-order bit first and the
low-order bit last.
To send a command to the clock, first set the rTCData bit of VIA data direction register B
(vBase+vDirB) so that the real-time clock's serial data line will be used for output to the clock.
Next, set the rTCClk bit of vBase+vBufB to 0, then set the rTCData bit to the value of the first
(high-order) bit of your data byte. Then raise (set to 1) the data-clock bit (rTCClk). Then lower
the data-clock, set the serial data line to the next bit, and raise the data-clock line again. After the
last bit of your command has been sent in this way, you can either continue by sending your data
byte in the same way (if your command was a write request) or switch to receiving a data byte
from the clock (if your command was a read request).
To receive a byte of data from the clock, you must first send a command that's a read request.
After you've clocked out the last bit of the command, clear the rTCData bit of the data direction
register so that the real-time clock's serial data line can be used for input from the clock; then
lower the data-clock bit (rTCClk) and read the first (high-order) bit of the clock's data byte on the
serial data line. Then raise the data-clock, lower it again, and read the next bit of data. Continue
this until all eight bits are read, then raise the serial enable line (rTCEnb }, disabling the data
transfer.
The following table lists the commands you can send to the clock. A 1 in the high-order bit
makes your command a read request; a 0 in the high-order bit makes your command a write
request. (In this table, "z" is the bit that determines read or write status, and bits marked "a" are
bits whose values depend on what parameter RAM byte you want to address.)

RAM address Oaaaa ($00-$0F)
```
```
Note that the last two bits of a command byte must always be 01.
```
If the high-order bit (bit 7) of the write-protect register is set, this prevents writing into any other
register on the clock chip (including parameter RAM). Clearing the bit allows you to change any
values in any registers on the chip. Don't try to read from this register; it's a write-only register.

The two highest-order bits (bits 7 and 6) of the test register are used as device control bits during
testing, and should always be set to 0 during normal operation. Setting them to anything else will
interfere with normal clock counting. Like the write-protect register, this is a write-only register;
don't try to read from it.

All clock data must be sent as full eight-bit bytes, even if only one or two bits are of interest. The
rest of the bits may not matter, but you must send them to the clock or the write will be aborted
when you raise the serial enable line.

It's important to use the proper sequence if you're writing to the clock's seconds registers. If you
write to a given seconds register, there's a chance that the clock may increment the data in the
next higher-order register during the write, causing unpredictable results. To avoid this
possibility, always write to the registers in low-to-high order. Similarly, the clock data may
increment during a read of all four time bytes, which could cause invalid data to be read. To
avoid this, always read the time twice (or until you get the same value twice).

```
Warning: When you've finished reading from the clock registers, always end by doing a
final write such as setting the write-protect bit. Failure to do this may leave the clock in a
state that will run down the battery more quickly than necessary.
```
The One-Second Interrupt

The clock also generates a VIA interrupt once each second (if this interrupt is enabled). The
enable status for this interrupt can be read from or written to bit 0 of the VlA's interrupt enable
register (vBase+vIER). When reading the enable register, a 1 bit indicates the interrupt is
enabled, and 0 means it's disabled. Writing $01 to the enable register disables the clock's one-
second interrupt (without affecting any other interrupts), while writing $81 enables it again. See
chapter 6 of Volume Il for more information about writing your own interrupt handlers.

```
Warning: Be sure when you write to bit 0 of the VIA's interrupt enable register that you
don't change any of the other bits.
```

THE VIA

The Synertek SY6522 Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA) controls the keyboard, internal real-
time clock, parts of the disk, sound, and mouse interfaces, and various internal Macintosh
signals. Its base address is available as the constant vBase and is also stored in a global variable
named VIA. The VIA is on the upper byte of the data bus, so use even-addressed byte accesses
only.

There are two parallel data registers within the VIA, called A and B, each with a data direction
register. There are also several event timers, a clocked shift register, and an interrupt flag register
with an interrupt enable register.
Normally you won't have to touch the direction registers, since the Operating System sets them
up for you at system startup. A 1 bit in a data direction register means the corresponding bit of
the respective data register will be used for output, while a 0 bit means it will be used for input.

```
Note: For more information on the registers and control structure of the VIA, consult the
technical specifications for the SY6522 chip.
```
VIA Register A

5 vHeadSel Disk SEL line
4 vOverlay ROM low-memory overlay

```
```
The vSCCWReq bit can signal that the SCC has received a character (used to maintain serial
communications during disk accesses, when the CPU's interrupts from the SCC are disabled).
The vPage2 bit controls which screen buffer is being displayed, and the vHeadSel bit is the SEL
control line used by the disk interface. The vOverlay bit (used only during system startup) can be
used to place another image of ROM at the bottom of memory, where RAM usually is (RAM
moves to $600000). The sound buffer is selected by the vSndPg2 bit. Finally, the vSound bits
control the sound volume.

The vSndEnb bit turns the sound generator on or off, and the vH4 bit is set when the video beam
is in its horizontal blanking period. The vY2 and vX2 bits read the quadrature signals from the Y
(vertical) and X (horizontal) directions, respectively, of the mouse's motion lines. The vSW bit
reads the mouse switch. The trCEnb, trCClk, and trCData bits control and read the real-time
clock.

The VIA Peripheral Control Register

```
The VIA's peripheral control register, at vBase+vPCR, allows you to set some very low-level
parameters (such as positive-edge or negative-edge triggering) dealing with the keyboard data and
clock intenupts, the one-second real-time clock intenupt line, and the vertical blanking intenupt.

The VIA Timers

```
The timers controlled by the VIA are called timer 1 and timer 2. Timer 1 is used to time various
events having to do with the Macintosh sound generator. Timer 2 is used by the Disk Driver to
time disk 1/0 events. If either timer isn't being used by the Operating System, you're free to use
it for your own purposes. When a timer counts down to 0, an intenupt will be generated if the
proper intenupt enable has been set. See chapter 6 of Volume II for information about writing
your own interrupt handlers.
To start one of the timers, store the appropriate values in the high-and low-order bytes of the
timer counter (or the timer 1 latches, for multiple use of the value). The counters and latches are
at the following locations:
```

```
```
Note: When setting a timer, it's not enough to simply store a full word to the high-order
address, because the high-and low-order bytes of the counters are not adjacent. You must
explicitly do two stores, one for the high-order byte and one for the low-order byte.
```
VIA Interrupts

The VIA (through its IRQ line) can cause a level-0 processor interrupt whenever one of the
following occurs: Timer 1 or timer 2 times out; the keyboard is clocking a bit in through its serial
port; the shift register for the keyboard serial interface has finished shifting in or out; the vertical
blanking interval is beginning; or the one-second clock has ticked. For more information on how
to use these interrupts, see chapter 6 of Volume II.

The interrupt flag register at vBase+vIFR contains flag bits that are set whenever the interrupt
corresponding to that bit has occurred. The Operating System uses these flags to determine
which device has caused an interrupt Bit 7 of the interrupt flag register is not really a flag: It
remains set (and the IRQ line to the processor is held low) as long as any enabled VIA interrupt is
occurring.

```
Bit Interrupting device
7 IRQ (all enabled VIA interrupts)
6 Timer^1
5 Timer2
4 Keyboard clock
3 Keyboard data bit
2 Keyboard data ready
1 Vertical blanking interrupt
0 One-second interrupt
```
The interrupt enable register, at vBase+vIER, lets you enable or disable any of these interrupts.
If an interrupt is disabled, its bit in the interrupt flag register will continue to be set whenever that
interrupt occurs, but it won't affect the IRQ flag, nor will it interrupt the processor.

The bits in the interrupt enable register are arranged just like those in the interrupt flag register,
except for bit 7. When you write to the interrupt enable register, bit 7 is "enable/disable": If bit 7
is a 1, each 1 in bits 0-6 enables the corresponding interrupt; if bit 7 is a 0, each 1 in bits 0-6
disables that interrupt In either case, O's in bits 0-6 do not change the status of those interrupts.
Bit 7 is always read as a 1.

```

Other VIA Registers

The shift register, at vBase+vSR, contains the eight bits of data that have been shifted in or that
will be shifted out over the keyboard data line.
The auxiliary control register, at vBase+vACR, is described in the SY6522 documentation. It
controls various parameters having to do with the timers and the shift register.

SYSTEM STARTUP

```
When power is first supplied to the Macintosh, a carefully orchestrated sequence of events takes
place.
First, the processor is held in a wait state while a series of circuits gets the system ready for
operation. The VIA and IWM are initialized, and the mapping of ROM and RAM are altered
temporarily by setting the overlay bit in VIA data register A. This places the ROM starting at the
normal ROM location $400000, and a duplicate image of the same ROM starting at address 0
(where RAM normally is), while RAM is placed starting at $600000. Under this mapping, the
Macintosh software executes out of the normal ROM locations above $400000, but the MC68000
can obtain some critical low-memory vectors from the ROM image it finds at address 0.
Next, a memory test and several other system tests take place. After the system is fully tested and
initialized, the software clears the VIA's overlay bit, mapping the system RAM back where it
belongs, starting at address 0. Then the disk startup process begins.
First the internal disk is checked: If there's a disk inserted, the system attempts to read it. If no
disk is in the internal drive and there's an external drive with an inserted disk, the system will try
to read that one. Otherwise, the question-mark disk icon is displayed until a disk is inserted. If
the disk startup fails for some reason, the "sad Macintosh" icon is displayed and the Macintosh

Once a readable disk has been inserted, the first two sectors (containing the system starrup
blocks) are read in and the normal disk load begins.

ABOUT THIS CHAPTER

This chapter includes all the summaries that appear at the end of other chapters of Inside
Macintosh. The summaries are arranged in alphabetical order of the pan of the Toolbox or
Operating System being summarized.

```
Note: The summaries of the Event Managers are listed under "Event Manager, Operating
System" and "Event Manager, Toolbox". The Toolbox and Operating System Utilities are
listed similarly.
```
The last section of this chapter, "Assembly Language", contains information for assembly-
language programmers only. It lists some miscellaneous global variables along with hardware-
related definitions for the Macintosh 128K and 512K.

Sound Driver Values for Notes

The following table contains values for the rate field of a four-tone synthesizer and the count field
of a square-wave synthesizer. A just-tempered scale-in the key of C, as an example- is given
in the first four columns; you can use a just-tempered scale for perfect tuning in a particular key.
The last four columns give an equal-tempered scale, for applications that may use any key; this
scale is appropriate for most Macintosh sound applications. Following this table is a list of the
ratios used in calculating these values, and instructions on how to calculate them for a just-
tempered scale in any key.

The following table gives the ratios used in calculating the above values. It shows the
relationship between the notes making up the just-tempered scale in the key of C; should you
need to implement a just-tempered scale in some other key, you can do so as follows: First get
the value of the root note in the proper octave in the equal-tempered scale (from the above table).
Then use the following table to determine the values of the intervals for the other notes in the key
by multiplying the ratio by the root note.

```
ID Explanation
1 Bus error: Invalid memory reference; happens only on a Macintosh XL
2 Address error: Word or long-word reference made to an odd address
3 Illegal instruction: The MC68000 received an instruction it didn't recognize.
4 :zero divide: Signed Divide (DIVS) or Unsigned Divide (DIVU) instruction with a
divisor of 0 was executed.
5 Check exception: Check Register Against Bounds (CHK) instruction was executed
and failed. Pascal "value out of range" errors are usually reported in this way.
6 TrapV exception: Trap On Overflow (TRAPV) instruction was executed and failed.
7 Privilege violation: Macintosh always runs in supervisor mode; perhaps an erroneous
Return From Execution (RTE) instruction was executed.
8 Trace exception: The trace bit in the status register is set.
9 Line 1010 exception: The 1010 trap dispatcher has failed.
10 Line 1111 exception: Unimplemented instruction
11 Miscellaneous exception: All other MC68000 exceptions
12 Unimplemented core routine: An unimplemented trap number was encountered.
13 Spurious interrupt: The interrupt vector table entry for a particular level of interrupt is
NIL; usually occurs with level 4, 5, 6, or 7 interrupts.
14 1/0 system error: The File Manager is attempting to dequeue an entry from an 1/0
request queue that has a bad queue type field; perhaps the queue entry is unlocked. Or,
the dCtlQHead field was NIL during a Fetch or Stash call. Or, a needed device control
entry has been purged.
15 Segment Loader error: A GetResource call to read a segment into memory failed.
16 Floating point error: The halt bit in the floating-point environment word was set.
17-24 Can't load package: A GetResource call to read a package into memory failed.
25 Can't allocate requested memory block in the heap
26 Segment Loader error: A GetResource call to read 'CODE' resource 0 into memory
failed; usually indicates a nonexecutable file.

APPENDIX A: RESULT CODES

This appendix lists all the result codes returned by the Macintosh system software. They're
ordered by value, fo r convenience when debugging; the names you should actually use in your
program are also listed.

The result codes are grouped roughly according to the lowest level at which the error may occur.
This doesn't mean that only routines at that level may cause those errors; hi gher-level software
may yield the same result codes. For example , an Operating System Utility routine that calls the
Memory Manager may return one of the Memory Manager result codes. Where a different or
more specific meaning is appropriate in a different context, that meaning is also listed.

APPENDIX B: ROUTINES THAT MAY MOVE OR PURGE

MEMORY

This appendix lists all the routines that may move or purge blocks in the heap. As described in
chapter 1 of Volume II, calling these routines may cause problems if a handle has been
dereferenced. None of these routines may be called from within an interrupt, such as in a
completion routine or a VBL task.

The Pascal name of each routine is shown, except for a few cases where there's no Pascal
interface corresponding to a particular trap; in those cases, the trap macro name is shown instead
(without its initial underscore character).

APPENDIX C: SYSTEM TRAPS

This appendix lists the trap macros for the Toolbox and Operating System routines and their
corresponding trap word values in hexadecimal. The "Name" column gives the trap macro name
(without its initial underscore character). In those cases where the name of the equivalent Pascal
call is different, the Pascal name appears indented under the main entry. The routines in
Macintosh packages are listed under the macros they invoke after pushing a routine selector onto
the stack; the routine selector follows the Pascal routine name in parentheses.

There are two tables: The first is ordered alphabetically by name; the second is ordered
numerically by trap number, for use when debugging. (The trap number is the last two digits of
the trap word unless the trap word begins with A9, in which case the trap number is 1 followed
by the last two digits of the trap word.)

```
Note: The Operating System Utility routines GetTrapAddress and SetTrapAddress take a trap
number as a parameter, not a trap word.
```
```
Warning: Traps that aren't currently used by the system are reserved for future use.

You won't have to look far to find a development language that suits your specific requirements. A
growing family of Macintosh languages will serve your development needs whether your expertise is in
Pascal, C, Assembler, FORTH, FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, Lisp, Modula-2, or one of many others.
And the information in Inside Macintosh can be applied to any of the Macintosh languages.

The Certified Developer Program
If your primary business is developing software products for commercial markets, we strongly suggest that
you investigate the Apple Certified Developer Program. This program helps developers produce and bring
Macintosh products to market by providing them with support programs, services, and information.
Among them are
•Technical Support: Apple's Developer Technical Support Group offers fast answers by way of
AppleLink® or MCI electronic mail.

- Macintosh Technical Notes: This is a bimonthly package of supplemental technical information.
- AppleLink: Through this electronic service, you can get answers to your technical questions and
    current information on Apple and third-party products and programs.
- Certified Developer Mailings: These monthly mailings keep you informed about Apple's
    products, development tools, and technical and company directions.
- The Information Exchange: This information, available in printed and HyperCard® stack form,
    lists company-sponsored programs and services available to you and your company.
- Outside Apple: This monthly newsletter informs you of developer-oriented Apple groups, programs,
    and events.
You must meet certain criteria to get Certified Developer status. You can get an information package and
